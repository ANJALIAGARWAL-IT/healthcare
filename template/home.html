      <h3> Hi, Anjali here </h3>

         <h3> <i>I have made a Medical Web App using Machine Learning and Deep Learning ðŸ’»</i> </h3>

         <br>
         <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Data analytics reflects trends on the particular subject based on comparison with historical dataset and present dataset. With the advancement of technology, healthcare predictive analytics at periodic interval affords insights into diseases collectively; identify risk of the patientsâ€™ health in future.  The novelty of this project is to analyse symptoms and healthcare datasets; to classify the categorized diseases using machine learning algorithm for better time management. Hence, the proposed model can save patients directly from risk to the particular disease based on the periodic trend analysis. On the contrary, the hospital will utilize the proposed model for future disease outbreaks. Web health applications are increasingly being used to perform tasks that are conventionally performed by general practitioners (GPs), such as those involved in promoting health, preventing disease, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and support for health services. Nowadays, medical checkups are very expensive and not everyone is capable to undergo such unaffordable tests, so to cope up with all of these problems this app is designed which would prove its benefits upto much extent.

         Web health applications are progressively being utillized to perform tasks that are conventionally performed by general practitioners (GPs) who are engaged in promoting health, preventing disease, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and support for health services. Nowadays, medical checkups are very expensive and not everyone is capable to undergo such unaffordable tests, so to cope up with all of these problems this app is designed which would prove its benefits upto much extent. This medical web app will be built using Machine Learning algorithms which will be able to predict the outcome of six major health problems which are as follows:  Corona, Cancer, Diabetes, Heart, Liver and Kidney diseases which are very common, thus helping people know whether they are suffering from this particular disease or not.</p>

    <h3>Application</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>This app can reach large numbers of people and is not limited by borders.</li>
      <li>To extend our hands to those needy people who cannot afford to undergo such expensive tests.</li>
      <li>To apply the upcoming technologies in a right way so that we can contribute to our society.</li>
      <li>â€¢	The healthcare app will allow the patients to monitor their health on a personal level and help them take timely action.</li>
      <li>It is a blessing for people from far remote areas</li>
    </ul>
